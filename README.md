# :christmas_tree: Advent-Of-Code-2017 :christmas_tree:

I decided to do this year's Advent of Code in Java. My expected outcome is to strengthen my knowledge and understanding of Java 8 lambdas and streams. Thus, some of my solutions may may have reduced readability and seem a bit "overstreamed" but it is for greater good.
